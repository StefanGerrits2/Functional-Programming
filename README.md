# Collection clothing and personal decoration

![readmeconceptimg2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45566396/68893729-08710e00-0726-11ea-9b66-7eb2583f53a3.png)

## Description

I made a bubble chart which contains every category relating to clothes. This visualisation is made with D3. Every bubble belongs to a group which have their own color. There's also a legend which tells you what the colors mean.

[Click here](https://github.com/StefanGerrits2/functional-programming/wiki/1.3-Gekozen-concept) to check out my concept in detail.

## Features

* Getting all data from API.
* Cleaning and transforming data.
* Showing all data in a bubble chart made with d3.
* Hovering over bubble for more information (name and amount of objects).

## Functional Programming
I wrote multiple functions that do their own things no matter what the input is. The output will always be the same. When data went through a function, I can pass this data to another function. This way it's easier to debug and it will be easy to re-use functions if I need to.

## Data transformation

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository to your computer
Run this command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/StefanGerrits2/functional-programming`
### 2. Navigate into the root of the folder
Run this command in your terminal:

`cd Functional-Programming`

### 3. Viewing the website
Open the `index.html` file in a browser.

> ###### NOTE:
> I use a plugin named `Preview on Web Server` to be able to see the project I'm working on. I need to do this because I use modules which you can't use if you just normally open your file in your browser.

## API

The data I use is provided by [this API](https://data.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/). The API contains 700.000 objects. I have written SPARQL queries to get the objects that I want. 

I collect these data:
* Category names
* Category value (amount of objects in each category)
* Upper category (subcategories can be part of a upper category)

Click [here](https://github.com/StefanGerrits2/functional-programming/wiki/2.4-SparQL-Query) for further explanation how my query works.
